	<h1> 2 Project Description </h1>
	<p class="projDesc"> VS-Saturn is an addon to VSCode that aids with time management by integrating routine breaks into a work period. Users can start a 25-minute timer where they will work to the best of their ability until the timer has completed. The user will be notified upon the timer’s completion anda checkmarkwill be placed next to the timer. They will be prompted to start a five-minute break period timerwhere they should rest their brain and refocus doing something they enjoy. Subsequently, the userwill beprompted to start another 25-minute timer and this process of alternating work and break periods will be repeated until four work periods have been completed. After the fourth work period, a 30-minute extended break period timer can be started. Normal work and break periods will follow until another four work periods have been completed.</p>
	<p class="projDesc"> At any point, the user can check the time remaining, pause, reset, or snooze the timer. Snoozing will extend the current timer by fiveminutes and can be done upto four timesfor break periods and as many times as the user wishes for work periods.All other timersincluding the five-minute snoozeand the notification for when a timer has been completedcan be configured in the settings. Possible notifications includechanging the theme of VSCode, a pop-up notificationwith or without an audible cue, an audible cue, or making the icon on the taskbar for VSCode flash. </p>
	<p class="projDesc"> To aidproductivity,the user’s goals and tasks for work periods can be tracked in a list. Tasks can be added, rearranged, checked off, anddeleted from the list.The user shouldadd tasksthat will be completed in the work period, rearrangethem according to their priority,and check them off upon completion. All tasks,the progression of the current timer, number of checkmarks, and previously configured settingswill be savedif VSCode is closed.</p>
